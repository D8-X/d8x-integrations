Yes you can.


## MockLego

The contract `MockLego.sol` provides an example on how D8X perpetual futures trades and checking position sizes
can be performed from another smart contract.

## Opening/Closing Trades
* Ensure the margin-token can be spent by the Perpetual Proxy, see the smart contract function `approveAmount`
* Ensure the calling contract also has enough of the margin token
* Open/close a position using `postOrder(tradeSizeInSignedDec18Format, leverageInteger)`
  - Enter a long position by supplying a positive `tradeSizeInSignedDec18Format`
  - Enter a short position by supplying a negative `tradeSizeInSignedDec18Format`
  - close the position by posting an order sized equal to the position size but opposite sign        
* Reading the size of your position
  ```
  let acc = await mockLego.getMarginAccount();
  let posDec18 = acc.positionSizeBCD18;
  ```
        
* Note that orders are not executed in the same block. Orders can however be executed by anyone when supplying offchain-oracle price data, see https://app.gitbook.com/o/84M6G9Tny4Cxv7BY10If/s/sivfyCjOhJUkKrxqsPg4/d8x-in-a-nutshell/d8x-introduction/referrers

### Constructor Variables
You can get the parameters used in the constructor of `MockLego.sol` with the help of 
* install packages: `yarn` 
* run: `ts-node src/scripts/contractAddresses.ts`
